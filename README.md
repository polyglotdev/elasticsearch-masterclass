## What is ElasticSearch?

- **ElasticSearch** is an open-source search engine.
- It is designed for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of data quickly and in near real-time.
- ElasticSearch is built on top of Apache Lucene, a powerful text search engine library.
- It is part of the Elastic Stack, which also includes tools like Logstash for data processing and Kibana for data visualization.

### Key Features:
1. **Core Principles**:
   - Understanding the core principles of ElasticSearch and Apache Lucene.
   - It provides distributed, RESTful search and analytics capabilities.
